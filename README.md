# Learning JavaScript ðŸš€

This repository contains projects I created while learning JavaScript. Since the focus was primarily on JavaScript development, not much time was spent on styling with CSS.

## Project List
1. [Basic Login Page](https://xdaxer.github.io/demos/basic-login-page): Login Page
2. [Another Project Name](another-project-link): Description for the other project.

## Contributions
